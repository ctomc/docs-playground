[[operating-modes]]
Operating modes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

WildFly can be booted in two different modes. A _managed domain_ allows
you to run and manage a multi-server topology. Alternatively, you can
run a _standalone server_ instance.

[[standalone-server]]
Standalone Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For many use cases, the centralized management capability available via
a managed domain is not necessary. For these use cases, a WildFly
instance can be run as a "standalone server". A standalone server
instance is an independent process, much like an JBoss Application
Server 3, 4, 5, or 6 instance is. Standalone instances can be launched
via the `standalone.sh` or `standalone.bat` launch scripts.

If more than one standalone instance is launched and multi-server
management is desired, it is the user's responsibility to coordinate
management across the servers. For example, to deploy an application
across all of the standalone servers, the user would need to
individually deploy the application on each server.

It is perfectly possible to launch multiple standalone server instances
and have them form an HA cluster, just like it was possible with JBoss
Application Server 3, 4, 5 and 6.

[[managed-domain]]
Managed Domain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One of the primary new features of WildFly is the ability to manage
multiple WildFly instances from a single control point. A collection of
such servers is referred to as the members of a "domain" with a single
Domain Controller process acting as the central management control
point. All of the WildFly instances in the domain share a common
management policy, with the Domain Controller acting to ensure that each
server is configured according to that policy. Domains can span multiple
physical (or virtual) machines, with all WildFly instances on a given
host under the control of a special Host Controller process. One Host
Controller instance is configured to act as the central Domain
Controller. The Host Controller on each host interacts with the Domain
Controller to control the lifecycle of the application server instances
running on its host and to assist the Domain Controller in managing
them.

When you launch a WildFly managed domain on a host (via the `domain.sh`
or `domain.bat` launch scripts) your intent is to launch a Host
Controller and usually at least one WildFly instance. On one of the
hosts the Host Controller should be configured to act as the Domain
Controller. See link:Domain_Setup.html[Domain Setup] for details.

The following is an example managed domain topology:

[[host]]
Host
++++

Each "Host" box in the above diagram represents a physical or virtual
host. A physical host can contain zero, one or more server instances.

[[host-controller]]
Host Controller
+++++++++++++++

When the domain.sh or domain.bat script is run on a host, a process
known as a Host Controller is launched. The Host Controller is solely
concerned with server management; it does not itself handle application
server workloads. The Host Controller is responsible for starting and
stopping the individual application server processes that run on its
host, and interacts with the Domain Controller to help manage them.

Each Host Controller by default reads its configuration from the
`domain/configuration/host.xml` file located in the unzipped WildFly
installation on its host's filesystem. The `host.xml` file contains
configuration information that is specific to the particular host.
Primarily:

* the listing of the names of the actual WildFly instances that are
meant to run off of this installation.
* configuration of how the Host Controller is to contact the Domain
Controller to register itself and access the domain configuration. This
may either be configuration of how to find and contact a remote Domain
Controller, or a configuration telling the Host Controller to itself act
as the Domain Controller.
* configuration of items that are specific to the local physical
installation. For example, named interface definitions declared in
`domain.xml` (see below) can be mapped to an actual machine-specific IP
address in `host.xml`. Abstract path names in `domain.xml` can be mapped
to actual filesystem paths in `host.xml`.

[[domain-controller]]
Domain Controller
+++++++++++++++++

One Host Controller instance is configured to act as the central
management point for the entire domain, i.e. to be the Domain
Controller. The primary responsibility of the Domain Controller is to
maintain the domain's central management policy, to ensure all Host
Controllers are aware of its current contents, and to assist the Host
Controllers in ensuring any running application server instances are
configured in accordance with this policy. This central management
policy is stored by default in the `domain/configuration/domain.xml`
file in the unzipped WildFly installation on Domain Controller's host's
filesystem.

A `domain.xml` file must be located in the `domain/configuration`
directory of an installation that's meant to run the Domain Controller.
It does not need to be present in installations that are not meant to
run a Domain Controller; i.e. those whose Host Controller is configured
to contact a remote Domain Controller. The presence of a `domain.xml`
file on such a server does no harm.

The `domain.xml` file includes, among other things, the configuration of
the various "profiles" that WildFly instances in the domain can be
configured to run. A profile configuration includes the detailed
configuration of the various subsystems that comprise that profile (e.g.
an embedded JBoss Web instance is a subsystem; a JBoss TS transaction
manager is a subsystem, etc). The domain configuration also includes the
definition of groups of sockets that those subsystems may open. The
domain configuration also includes the definition of "server groups":

[[server-group]]
Server Group
++++++++++++

A server group is set of server instances that will be managed and
configured as one. In a managed domain each application server instance
is a member of a server group. (Even if the group only has a single
server, the server is still a member of a group.) It is the
responsibility of the Domain Controller and the Host Controllers to
ensure that all servers in a server group have a consistent
configuration. They should all be configured with the same profile and
they should have the same deployment content deployed.

The domain can have multiple server groups. The above diagram shows two
server groups, "ServerGroupA" and "ServerGroupB". Different server
groups can be configured with different profiles and deployments; for
example in a domain with different tiers of servers ﻿providing different
services. Different server groups can also run the same profile and have
the same deployments; for example to support rolling application upgrade
scenarios where a complete service outage is avoided by first upgrading
the application on one server group and then upgrading a second server
group.

An example server group definition is as follows:

[source,java]
----
<server-group name="main-server-group" profile="default">
    <socket-binding-group ref="standard-sockets"/>
    <deployments>
        <deployment name="foo.war_v1" runtime-name="foo.war" />
        <deployment name="bar.ear" runtime-name="bar.ear" />
    </deployments>
</server-group>
----

A server-group configuration includes the following required attributes:

* name -- the name of the server group
* profile -- the name of the profile the servers in the group should run

In addition, the following optional elements are available:

* socket-binding-group -- specifies the name of the default socket
binding group to use on servers in the group. Can be overridden on a
per-server basis in `host.xml`. If not provided in the `server-group`
element, it must be provided for each server in `host.xml`.
* deployments -- the deployment content that should be deployed on the
servers in the group.
* deployment-overlays -- the overlays and their associated deployments.
* system-properties -- system properties that should be set on all
servers in the group
* jvm -- default jvm settings for all servers in the group. The Host
Controller will merge these settings with any provided in `host.xml` to
derive the settings to use to launch the server's JVM. See
link:JVM_settings.html[JVM settings] for further details.

[[server]]
Server
++++++

Each "Server" in the above diagram represents an actual application
server instance. The server runs in a separate JVM process from the Host
Controller. The Host Controller is responsible for launching that
process. (In a managed domain the end user cannot directly launch a
server process from the command line.)

 The Host Controller synthesizes the server's configuration by combining
elements from the domain wide configuration (from `domain.xml` ) and the
host-specific configuration (from `host.xml` ).

[[deciding-between-running-standalone-servers-or-a-managed-domain]]
Deciding between running standalone servers or a managed domain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Which use cases are appropriate for managed domain and which are
appropriate for standalone servers? A managed domain is all about
coordinated multi-server management -- with it WildFly provides a
central point through which users can manage multiple servers, with rich
capabilities to keep those servers' configurations consistent and the
ability to roll out configuration changes (including deployments) to the
servers in a coordinated fashion.

It's important to understand that the choice between a managed domain
and standalone servers is all about how your servers are managed, not
what capabilities they have to service end user requests. This
distinction is particularly important when it comes to high availability
clusters. It's important to understand that HA functionality is
orthogonal to running standalone servers or a managed domain. That is, a
group of standalone servers can be configured to form an HA cluster. The
domain and standalone modes determine how the servers are managed, not
what capabilities they provide.

So, given all that:

* A single server installation gains nothing from running in a managed
domain, so running a standalone server is a better choice.
* For multi-server production environments, the choice of running a
managed domain versus standalone servers comes down to whether the user
wants to use the centralized management capabilities a managed domain
provides. Some enterprises have developed their own sophisticated
multi-server management capabilities and are comfortable coordinating
changes across a number of independent WildFly instances. For these
enterprises, a multi-server architecture comprised of individual
standalone servers is a good option.
* Running a standalone server is better suited for most development
scenarios. Any individual server configuration that can be achieved in a
managed domain can also be achieved in a standalone server, so even if
the application being developed will eventually run in production on a
managed domain installation, much (probably most) development can be
done using a standalone server.
* Running a managed domain mode can be helpful in some advanced
development scenarios; i.e. those involving interaction between multiple
WildFly instances. Developers may find that setting up various servers
as members of a domain is an efficient way to launch a multi-server
cluster.

[[general-configuration-concepts]]
General configuration concepts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For both a managed domain or a standalone server, a number of common
configuration concepts apply:

[[108625993_Coremanagementconcepts-extensions]]
[[108625993_Coremanagementconcepts-extensions]]

[[extensions]]
Extensions
^^^^^^^^^^

An extension is a module that extends the core capabilities of the
server. The WildFly core is very simple and lightweight; most of the
capabilities people associate with an application server are provided
via extensions. An extension is packaged as a module in the `modules`
folder. The user indicates that they want a particular extension to be
available by including an `<extension/>` element naming its module in
the `domain.xml` or `standalone.xml` file.

[source,java]
----
<extensions>
    [...]
    <extension module="org.jboss.as.transactions"/>
    <extension module="org.jboss.as.webservices" />
    <extension module="org.jboss.as.weld" />
    [...]
    <extension module="org.wildfly.extension.undertow"/>
</extensions>
----

[[108625993_Coremanagementconcepts-profiles]]
[[108625993_Coremanagementconcepts-profiles]]

[[profiles-and-subsystems]]
Profiles and Subsystems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The most significant part of the configuration in `domain.xml` and
`standalone.xml` is the configuration of one (in `standalone.xml`) or
more (in `domain.xml`) "profiles". A profile is a named set of subsystem
configurations. A subsystem is an added set of capabilities added to the
core server by an extension (see "Extensions" above). A subsystem
provides servlet handling capabilities; a subsystem provides an EJB
container; a subsystem provides JTA, etc. A profile is a named list of
subsystems, along with the details of each subsystem's configuration. A
profile with a large number of subsystems results in a server with a
large set of capabilities. A profile with a small, focused set of
subsystems will have fewer capabilities but a smaller footprint.

The content of an individual profile configuration looks largely the
same in `domain.xml` and `standalone.xml`. The only difference is
`standalone.xml` is only allowed to have a single profile element (the
profile the server will run), while `domain.xml` can have many profiles,
each of which can be mapped to one or more groups of servers.

The contents of individual subsystem configurations look exactly the
same between `domain.xml` and `standalone.xml`.

[[108625993_Coremanagementconcepts-paths]]
[[108625993_Coremanagementconcepts-paths]]

[[paths]]
Paths
^^^^^

A logical name for a filesystem path. The `domain.xml`, `host.xml` and
`standalone.xml` configurations all include a section where paths can be
declared. Other sections of the configuration can then reference those
paths by their logical name, rather than having to include the full
details of the path (which may vary on different machines). For example,
the logging subsystem configuration includes a reference to the "
`jboss.server.log.dir`" path that points to the server's " `log`"
directory.

[source,java]
----
<file relative-to="jboss.server.log.dir" path="server.log"/>
----

WildFly automatically provides a number of standard paths without any
need for the user to configure them in a configuration file:

* `jboss.home`.dir - the root directory of the WildFly distribution
* `user.home` - user's home directory
* `user.dir` - user's current working directory
* `java.home` - java installation directory
* `jboss.server.base.dir` - root directory for an individual server
instance
* `jboss.server.config.dir` - directory the server will use for
configuration file storage
* `jboss.server.data.dir` - directory the server will use for persistent
data file storage
* `jboss.server.log.dir` - directory the server will use for log file
storage
* `jboss.server.temp.dir` - directory the server will use for temporary
file storage
* `jboss.controller.temp.dir` - directory the server will use for
temporary file storage
* `jboss.domain.servers.dir` - directory under which a host controller
will create the working area for individual server instances (managed
domain mode only)

Users can add their own paths or override all except the first 5 of the
above by adding a `<path/>` element to their configuration file.

[source,java]
----
<path name="example" path="example" relative-to="jboss.server.data.dir"/>
----

 The attributes are:

* `name` -- the name of the path.
* `path` -- the actual filesystem path. Treated as an absolute path,
unless the 'relative-to' attribute is specified, in which case the value
is treated as relative to that path.
* `relative-to` -- (optional) the name of another previously named path,
or of one of the standard paths provided by the system.

A `<path/>` element in a `domain.xml` need not include anything more
than the `name` attribute; i.e. it need not include any information
indicating what the actual filesystem path is: 

[source,java]
----
<path name="x"/>
----

Such a configuration simply says, "There is a path named 'x' that other
parts of the `domain.xml` configuration can reference. The actual
filesystem location pointed to by 'x' is host-specific and will be
specified in each machine's `host.xml` file." If this approach is used,
there must be a path element in each machine's `host.xml` that specifies
what the actual filesystem path is:

[source,java]
----
<path name="x" path="/var/x" />
----

A `<path/>` element in a `standalone.xml` must include the specification
of the actual filesystem path.

[[108625993_Coremanagementconcepts-interfaces]]
[[108625993_Coremanagementconcepts-interfaces]]

[[interfaces]]
Interfaces
^^^^^^^^^^

A logical name for a network interface/IP address/host name to which
sockets can be bound. The `domain.xml`, `host.xml` and `standalone.xml`
configurations all include a section where interfaces can be declared.
Other sections of the configuration can then reference those interfaces
by their logical name, rather than having to include the full details of
the interface (which may vary on different machines). An interface
configuration includes the logical name of the interface as well as
information specifying the criteria to use for resolving the actual
physical address to use. See  link:Interfaces_and_ports.html[Interfaces
and ports] for further details.

An `<interface/>` element in a `domain.xml` need not include anything
more than the `name` attribute; i.e. it need not include any information
indicating what the actual IP address associated with the name is:

[source,java]
----
<interface name="internal"/>
----

Such a configuration simply says, "There is an interface named
'internal' that other parts of the domain.xml configuration can
reference. The actual IP address pointed to by 'internal' is
host-specific and will be specified in each machine's host.xml file." If
this approach is used, there must be an interface element in each
machine's `host.xml` that specifies the criteria for determining the IP
address:

[source,java]
----
<interface name="internal">
   <nic name="eth1"/>
</interface>
----

An `<interface/>` element in a `standalone.xml` must include the
criteria for determining the IP address.

[[108625993_Coremanagementconcepts-socketbindings]]
[[108625993_Coremanagementconcepts-socketbindings]]

[[socket-bindings-and-socket-binding-groups]]
Socket Bindings and Socket Binding Groups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A socket binding is a named configuration for a socket.

The `domain.xml` and `standalone.xml` configurations both include a
section where named socket configurations can be declared. Other
sections of the configuration can then reference those sockets by their
logical name, rather than having to include the full details of the
socket configuration (which may vary on different machines). See
link:Interfaces_and_ports.html[Interfaces and ports] for full details.

[[108625993_Coremanagementconcepts-systemproperties]]
[[108625993_Coremanagementconcepts-systemproperties]]

[[system-properties]]
System Properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

System property values can be set in a number of places in `domain.xml`,
`host.xml` and `standalone.xml`. The values in `standalone.xml` are set
as part of the server boot process. Values in `domain.xml` and
`host.xml` are applied to servers when they are launched.

When a system property is configured in `domain.xml` or `host.xml`, the
servers it ends up being applied to depends on where it is set. Setting
a system property in a child element directly under the `domain.xml`
root results in the property being set on all servers. Setting it in a
`<system-property/>` element inside a `<server-group/>` element in
domain.xml results in the property being set on all servers in the
group. Setting it in a child element directly under the `host.xml` root
results in the property being set on all servers controlled by that
host's Host Controller. Finally, setting it in a `<system-property/>`
element inside a `<server/>` element in `host.xml` result in the
property being set on that server. The same property can be configured
in multiple locations, with a value in a `<server/>` element taking
precedence over a value specified directly under the `host.xml` root
element, the value in a `host.xml` taking precedence over anything from
`domain.xml`, and a value in a `<server-group/>` element taking
precedence over a value specified directly under the `domain.xml` root
element.

[[management-resources]]
Management resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When WildFly parses your configuration files at boot, or when you use
one of the AS's link:Management_Clients.html[Management Clients] you are
adding, removing or modifying _management resources_ in the AS's
internal management model. A WildFly management resource has the
following characteristics:

[[address]]
Address
^^^^^^^

All WildFly management resources are organized in a tree. The path to
the node in the tree for a particular resource is its _address_. Each
segment in a resource's address is a key/value pair:

* The key is the resource's _type_, in the context of its parent. So,
for example, the root resource for a standalone server has children of
type `subsystem`, `interface`, `socket-binding`, etc. The resource for
the subsystem that provides the AS's webserver capability has children
of type `connector` and `virtual-server`. The resource for the subsystem
that provides the AS's messaging server capability has, among others,
children of type `jms-queue` and `jms-topic`.
* The value is the name of a particular resource of the given type, e.g
`web` or `messaging` for subsystems or `http` or `https` for web
subsystem connectors.

The full address for a resource is the ordered list of key/value pairs
that lead from the root of the tree to the resource. Typical notation is
to separate the elements in the address with a '/' and to separate the
key and the value with an '=':

* `/subsystem=undertow/server=default-server/http-listener=default`
* `/subsystem=messaging/jms-queue=testQueue`
* `/interface=public`

When using the HTTP API, a '/' is used to separate the key and the value
instead of an '=':

* `http://localhost:9990/management/subsystem/undertow/server/default-server/http-listener/default`
* `http://localhost:9990/management/subsystem/messaging/jms-queue/testQueue`
* `http://localhost:9990/management/interface/public`

[[operations]]
Operations
^^^^^^^^^^

Querying or modifying the state of a resource is done via an operation.
An operation has the following characteristics:

* A string name
* Zero or more named parameters. Each parameter has a string name, and a
value of type `org.jboss.dmr.ModelNode` (or, when invoked via the CLI,
the text representation of a `ModelNode`; when invoked via the HTTP API,
the JSON representation of a `ModelNode`.) Parameters may be optional.
* A return value, which will be of type `org.jboss.dmr.ModelNode` (or,
when invoked via the CLI, the text representation of a `ModelNode`; when
invoked via the HTTP API, the JSON representation of a `ModelNode`.)

Every resource except the root resource will have an `add` operation and
should have a `remove` operation ("should" because in WildFly 8 many do
not). The parameters for the `add` operation vary depending on the
resource. The `remove` operation has no parameters.

There are also a number of "global" operations that apply to all
resources. See link:Global_operations.html[Global operations] for full
details.

The operations a resource supports can themselves be determined by
invoking an operation: the `read-operation-names` operation. Once the
name of an operation is known, details about its parameters and return
value can be determined by invoking the `read-operation-description`
operation. For example, to learn the names of the operations exposed by
the root resource for a standalone server, and then learn the full
details of one of them, via the CLI one would:

[source,java]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] :read-operation-names
{
    "outcome" => "success",
    "result" => [
        "add-namespace",
        "add-schema-location",
        "delete-snapshot",

    ]
}

{
    "outcome" => "success",
    "result" => {
        "operation-name" => "upload-deployment-url",
        "description" => "Indicates that the deployment content available at the included URL should be added to the deployment content repository. Note that this operation does not indicate the content should be deployed into the runtime.",
        "request-properties" => {"url" => {
            "type" => STRING,
            "description" => "The URL at which the deployment content is available for upload to the domain's or standalone server's deployment content repository.. Note that the URL must be accessible from the target of the operation (i.e. the Domain Controller or standalone server).",
            "required" => true,
            "min-length" => 1,
            "nillable" => false
        }},
        "reply-properties" => {
            "type" => BYTES,

            "min-length" => 20,
            "max-length" => 20,
            "nillable" => false
        }
    }
}
----

See
link:Core_management_concepts.html#108625993_Coremanagementconcepts-Descriptions[Descriptions]
below for more on how to learn about the operations a resource exposes.

[[attributes]]
Attributes
^^^^^^^^^^

Management resources expose information about their state as attributes.
Attributes have string name, and a value of type
`org.jboss.dmr.ModelNode` (or: for the CLI, the text representation of a
`ModelNode`; for HTTP API, the JSON representation of a `ModelNode`.)

Attributes can either be read-only or read-write. Reading and writing
attribute values is done via the global `read-attribute` and
`write-attribute` operations.

The `read-attribute` operation takes a single parameter "name" whose
value is a the name of the attribute. For example, to read the "port"
attribute of a socket-binding resource via the CLI:

[source,java]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /socket-binding-group=standard-sockets/socket-binding=https:read-attribute(name=port)
{
    "outcome" => "success",
    "result" => 8443
}
----

If an attribute is writable, the `write-attribute` operation is used to
mutate its state. The operation takes two parameters:

* `name` – the name of the attribute
* `value` – the value of the attribute

For example, to read the "port" attribute of a socket-binding resource
via the CLI:

[source,java]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /socket-binding-group=standard-sockets/socket-binding=https:write-attribute(name=port,value=8444)
{"outcome" => "success"}
----

Attributes can have one of two possible _storage types_:

* *CONFIGURATION* – means the value of the attribute is stored in the
persistent configuration; i.e. in the `domain.xml`, `host.xml` or
`standalone.xml` file from which the resource's configuration was read.
* *RUNTIME* – the attribute value is only available from a running
server; the value is not stored in the persistent configuration. A
metric (e.g. number of requests serviced) is a typical example of a
RUNTIME attribute.

The values of all of the attributes a resource exposes can be obtained
via the `read-resource` operation, with the "include-runtime" parameter
set to "true". For example, from the CLI:

[source,java]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /subsystem=undertow/server=default-server/http-listener=default:read-resource(include-runtime=true)
{
    "outcome" => "success",
    "result" => {
        "allow-encoded-slash" => false,
        "allow-equals-in-cookie-value" => false,
        "always-set-keep-alive" => true,
        "buffer-pipelined-data" => true,
        "buffer-pool" => "default",
        "bytes-received" => 0L,
        "bytes-sent" => 0L,
        "certificate-forwarding" => false,
        "decode-url" => true,
        "disallowed-methods" => ["TRACE"],
        "enable-http2" => false,
        "enabled" => true,
        "error-count" => 0L,
        "max-buffered-request-size" => 16384,
        "max-connections" => undefined,
        "max-cookies" => 200,
        "max-header-size" => 1048576,
        "max-headers" => 200,
        "max-parameters" => 1000,

See
link:Core_management_concepts.html#108625993_Coremanagementconcepts-Descriptions[Descriptions]
below for how to learn more about the attributes a particular resource
exposes.

[[children]]
Children
^^^^^^^^

Management resources may support child resources. The
link:Core_management_concepts.html#108625993_Coremanagementconcepts-Address[_types_
of children] a resource supports (e.g. `connector` for the web subsystem
resource) can be obtained by querying the resource's description (see
link:Core_management_concepts.html#108625993_Coremanagementconcepts-Descriptions[Descriptions]
below) or by invoking the `read-children-types` operation. Once you know
the legal child types, you can query the names of all children of a
given type by using the global `read-children-types` operation. The
operation takes a single parameter "child-type" whose value is the type.
For example, a resource representing a socket binding group has
children. To find the type of those children and the names of resources
of that type via the CLI one could:

[source,java]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /socket-binding-group=standard-sockets:read-children-types
{
    "outcome" => "success",
    "result" => ["socket-binding"]
}
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /socket-binding-group=standard-sockets:read-children-names(child-type=socket-binding)
{
    "outcome" => "success",
    "result" => [
        "http",
        "https",
        "jmx-connector-registry",
        "jmx-connector-server",
        "jndi",
        "osgi-http",
        "remoting",
        "txn-recovery-environment",
        "txn-status-manager"
    ]
}
----

[[descriptions]]
Descriptions
^^^^^^^^^^^^

All resources expose metadata that describes their attributes,
operations and child types. This metadata is itself obtained by invoking
one or more of the link:Global_operations.html[global operations] each
resource supports. We showed examples of the `read-operation-names`,
`read-operation-description`, `read-children-types` and
`read-children-names` operations above.

The `read-resource-description` operation can be used to find the
details of the attributes and child types associated with a resource.
For example, using the CLI:

[source,java]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /socket-binding-group=standard-sockets:read-resource-description
{
    "outcome" => "success",
    "result" => {
        "description" => "Contains a list of socket configurations.",
        "head-comment-allowed" => true,
        "tail-comment-allowed" => false,
        "attributes" => {
            "name" => {
                "type" => STRING,
                "description" => "The name of the socket binding group.",
                "required" => true,
                "head-comment-allowed" => false,
                "tail-comment-allowed" => false,
                "access-type" => "read-only",
                "storage" => "configuration"
            },
            "default-interface" => {
                "type" => STRING,
                "description" => "Name of an interface that should be used as the interface for any sockets that do not explicitly declare one.",
                "required" => true,
                "head-comment-allowed" => false,
                "tail-comment-allowed" => false,
                "access-type" => "read-write",
                "storage" => "configuration"
            },
            "port-offset" => {
                "type" => INT,
                "description" => "Increment to apply to the base port values defined in the socket bindings to derive the runtime values to use on this server.",
                "required" => false,
                "head-comment-allowed" => true,
                "tail-comment-allowed" => false,
                "access-type" => "read-write",
                "storage" => "configuration"
            }
        },
        "operations" => {},
        "children" => {"socket-binding" => {
            "description" => "The individual socket configurtions.",
            "min-occurs" => 0,
            "model-description" => undefined
        }}
    }
}
----

Note the
`"operations" => }} in the output above. If the command had included the {{operations`
parameter (i.e.
`/socket-binding-group=standard-sockets:read-resource-description(operations=true)`)
the output would have included the description of each operation
supported by the resource.

See the link:Global_operations.html[Global operations] section for
details on other parameters supported by the `read-resource-description`
operation and all the other globally available operations.

[[comparison-to-jmx-mbeans]]
Comparison to JMX MBeans
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

WildFly management resources are conceptually quite similar to Open
MBeans. They have the following primary differences:

* WildFly management resources are organized in a tree structure. The
order of the key value pairs in a resource's address is significant, as
it defines the resource's position in the tree. The order of the key
properties in a JMX `ObjectName` is not significant.
* In an Open MBean attribute values, operation parameter values and
operation return values must either be one of the simple JDK types
(String, Boolean, Integer, etc) or implement either the
`javax.management.openmbean.CompositeData` interface or the
`javax.management.openmbean.TabularData` interface. WildFly management
resource attribute values, operation parameter values and operation
return values are all of type `org.jboss.dmr.ModelNode`.

[[basic-structure-of-the-management-resource-trees]]
Basic structure of the management resource trees
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As noted above, management resources are organized in a tree structure.
The structure of the tree depends on whether you are running a
standalone server or a managed domain.

[[standalone-server-1]]
Standalone server
+++++++++++++++++

The structure of the managed resource tree is quite close to the
structure of the `standalone.xml` configuration file.

* The root resource
** `extension` – extensions installed in the server
** `path` – paths available on the server
** `system-property` – system properties set as part of the
configuration (i.e. not on the command line)
** `core-service=management` – the server's core management services
** `core-service=service-container` – resource for the JBoss MSC
`ServiceContainer` that's at the heart of the AS
** `subsystem` – the subsystems installed on the server. The bulk of the
management model will be children of type `subsystem`
** `interface` – interface configurations
** `socket-binding-group` – the central resource for the server's socket
bindings
*** `socket-binding` – individual socket binding configurations
** `deployment` – available deployments on the server

[[managed-domain-1]]
Managed domain
++++++++++++++

In a managed domain, the structure of the managed resource tree spans
the entire domain, covering both the domain wide configuration (e.g.
what's in `domain.xml`, the host specific configuration for each host
(e.g. what's in `host.xml`, and the resources exposed by each running
application server. The Host Controller processes in a managed domain
provide access to all or part of the overall resource tree. How much is
available depends on whether the management client is interacting with
the Host Controller that is acting as the master Domain Controller. If
the Host Controller is the master Domain Controller, then the section of
the tree for each host is available. If the Host Controller is a slave
to a remote Domain Controller, then only the portion of the tree
associated with that host is available.

* The root resource for the entire domain. The persistent configuration
associated with this resource and its children, except for those of type
`host`, is persisted in the `domain.xml` file on the Domain Controller.
** `extension` – extensions available in the domain
** `path` – paths available on across the domain
** `system-property` – system properties set as part of the
configuration (i.e. not on the command line) and available across the
domain
** `profile` – sets of subsystem configurations that can be assigned to
server groups
*** `subsystem` – configuration of subsystems that are part of the
profile
** `interface` – interface configurations
** `socket-binding-group` – sets of socket bindings configurations that
can be applied to server groups
*** `socket-binding` – individual socket binding configurations
** `deployment` – deployments available for assignment to server groups
** deployment-overlay -- deployment-overlays content available to
overlay deployments in server groups
** `server-group` – server group configurations
** host – the individual Host Controllers. Each child of this type
represents the root resource for a particular host. The persistent
configuration associated with one of these resources or its children is
persisted in the host's `host.xml` file.
*** `path` – paths available on each server on the host
*** `system-property` – system properties to set on each server on the
host
*** `core-service=management` – the Host Controller's core management
services
*** `interface` – interface configurations that apply to the Host
Controller or servers on the host
*** `jvm` – JVM configurations that can be applied when launching
servers
*** `server-config` – configuration describing how the Host Controller
should launch a server; what server group configuration to use, and any
server-specific overrides of items specified in other resources
*** `server` – the root resource for a running server. Resources from
here and below are not directly persisted; the domain-wide and host
level resources contain the persistent configuration that drives a
server
**** `extension` – extensions installed in the server
**** `path` – paths available on the server
**** `system-property` – system properties set as part of the
configuration (i.e. not on the command line)
**** `core-service=management` – the server's core management services
**** `core-service=service-container` – resource for the JBoss MSC
`ServiceContainer` that's at the heart of the AS
**** `subsystem` – the subsystems installed on the server. The bulk of
the management model will be children of type `subsystem`
**** `interface` – interface configurations
**** `socket-binding-group` – the central resource for the server's
socket bindings
***** `socket-binding` – individual socket binding configurations
**** `deployment` – available deployments on the server
**** deployment-overlay -- available overlays on the server
