Troubleshooting Common Issues
=============================

[[timeouts]]
= Timeouts

May happen especially on slower computers. Try setting a different
timeout (in seconds) :

-Dsurefire.forked.process.timeout=9999

[[server-already-running]]
= "Server already running"

Known issue: https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBPAPP-8368[JBPAPP-8368]
Arquillian should wait until a port is free after AS JVM process ends to
prevent "port in use".

[line-through]*Currently, the only solution is to re-run.* This has been
fixed in 7.1.2, see pull request
https://github.com/jbossas/jboss-as/pull/1999 .

[[database-failures]]
= Database failures

[[build-gets-stuck-at-first-test-of-a-module]]
= Build gets stuck at first test of a module

If you use NFS (Network file system), it might be a file locking issue.

Try running using a local disk.
