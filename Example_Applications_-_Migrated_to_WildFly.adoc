[[example-applications-migrated-from-previous-releases]]
Example Applications Migrated from Previous Releases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The applications in this section were written for a previous version of
the server but have been modified to run on WildFly 8. Changes were made
to resolve issues that arose during deployment and runtime or to fix
problems with application behaviour. Each example below documents the
changes that were made to get the application to run successfully on
WildFly.

[[seam-2-jpa-example]]
Seam 2 JPA example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To see details on changes required to run this application on WildFly,

2 JPA example deployment on WildFly 8].

[[seam-2-dvd-store-example]]
Seam 2 DVD Store example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[[seam-2-booking-example]]
Seam 2 Booking example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For details on how to migrate this demo application, see

[[seam-2-booking---step-by-step-migration-of-binaries]]
Seam 2 Booking - step-by-step migration of binaries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This document takes a somewhat different "brute force" approach. The
idea is to deploy the binaries to WildFly, then see what issues you hit
and learn how debug and resolve them. See
https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS7/Seam+2+Booking+EAR+Migration+of+Binaries+-+Step+by+Step[Seam
2 Booking EAR Migration of Binaries - Step by Step].

A step by step work through of issues, and their solutions, that might
crop up when migrating applications to WildFly 8. See the following

[[example-applications-based-on-ee6]]
Example Applications Based on EE6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Applications in this section were designed and written specifically to
use the features and functions of EE6.

* Quickstarts: A number of quickstart applications were written to
demonstrate Java EE 6 and a few additional technologies. They provide
small, specific, working examples that can be used as a reference for
your own project. For more information about the quickstarts, see
http://www.jboss.org/jdf/quickstarts/jboss-as-quickstart/guide/Introduction/[Get
Started Developing Applications]
